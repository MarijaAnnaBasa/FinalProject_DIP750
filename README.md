Moreover, the current project contains the four required functionalities, i.e., navigation menu with links to different sections of the web page, input field, a button with a click event handler, as well as a SVG icon. The web page created also conatins a main part which is regarded towards the index.html file that further controls everything and additional functions manifested through JavaScript functions.
